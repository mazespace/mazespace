#Definitions

	Maze-Space:
		 The infinite expanse of a level. Spacially rhizomatic. Paths reveal themselves to the player only to be eaten again in their wake. This could mean there is a radius around the player which corresponds to the section of maze that is currently manifested, but perhaps other setups are possible, perhaps in conjunction. 
	Origin:
		There are cartesian Origins of the mazespace. This Origin defines the relative distances of associated Nodes. Two Origins may lack a spacial relationship. Any Origin can shift and be shifted about the plane, per an Event. Alternatively, the origin can be shifted according to maze Expansion rules. An origin carries with it its associated Nodes. An Origin is a special case of a Node.
	Node:
		An important structure, a narrative trigger, an invisible marker etc. Nodes can have fixed spacial relationships. A Node can be its own Origin. Many Nodes will serve as hub spaces for the player or other narrative anchors.
	Maze-Space Event:
		An Event is a narrative or mechanical device which has an affect on the arrangement of the Maze-Space. It could open a new path to the player, or reveal a hidden Node or Origin.
	Cell:
		One element of the repeating structure 
	Template:
		Highest level of pre-defined content which randomly fills the maze-space. A templates bounds are comprise one or more cells. The rotational symmetry of a template is limited by entrances and exits, such that doors only match to doors, and walls only match to walls etc.


	Superstructure:
		a structure of nodes that supersedes the plane. Usually not accessible to the player.
		Powerlines with towers, aqueducts, possibly other utilities. 
		Theoretical:
			clouds, day/night cycle.
			HAARP Array
			



##Notes:

	There is no instantaneous teleportation in Maze-Space, only compressing of Maze-Space. This isn't ruling out differently shaped spaces. The Torus for example is a space which when traversed behaves like the fighter in Asteroids--off one edge and onto the opposite.



	Nodes are fixed in space, with flexible spaces in between.

	For example, three nodes could exist in a triangle where any of the sides could contain an infinite amount of Maze-Space between them. 

	Each level will have to follow a geometric scheme including:
		square cartesian
		hexagonal
		penrose
		others are possible such as
		octagon + diamonds


	Any grid system can be used at diffing scales.

	Node Cells can be combinations of k
